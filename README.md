# 📘 School Management Module — Odoo

Custom Odoo application to automate administrative and academic operations for schools.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **School Management Module** is a custom Odoo application developed to simplify and automate key administrative and academic operations within a school environment. It was created as part of my internship project, focusing on implementing an end-to-end school ERP solution using **Odoo’s ORM framework**, **Python**, and **XML**.

This module helps manage *students, teachers, classes, subjects, attendance, fees,* and *results* efficiently — all from one unified dashboard.
