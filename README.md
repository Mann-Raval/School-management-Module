📘 Overview

The School Management Module is a custom Odoo application developed to simplify and automate key administrative and academic operations within a school environment.
It was created as part of my internship project, focusing on implementing an end-to-end school ERP solution using Odoo’s ORM framework, Python, and XML.

This module helps manage students, teachers, classes, subjects, attendance, fees, and results efficiently — all from one unified dashboard.
